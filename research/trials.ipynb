As I \\nwrite this, I look forward to a year of \\npromise and progress powered by speed, \\nagility, and most of all, sustainable \\ntransformation. \\nAt the core of Mission Transformation lies \\nour single-minded pursuit of technology - \\nthrough par tnerships and through \\nresearch & development, with global tech \\nand with fresh state-of-the-art design \\ndevelopments. This vision of  Texmaco - \\nthe premier multi-discipline, multi-unit \\nengineering and infrastructure company \\nas preferred tech-driven leader in the ﬁeld, \\nis aligned with the Indian Railways' mission \\nfor growth and sustainability.\\nOur growth story is riding the Indian \\neconomic juggernaut. The world's ﬁfth-\\nlargest and fastest-growing economy has \\ndeﬁed global trends with rigour and \\nr e s i l i e n c e .  T h e  p r o j e c t i o n  b y  t h e \\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) shows \\nIndia's gross domestic product (GDP) \\ngrowing at 7.2 per cent in 2022-23. Three \\nm e g a t r e n d s  -  g l o b a l  o ﬀ s h o r i n g , \\ndigitalisation and energy transition - are \\nfuelling this growth in a country boasting \\n1.4 billion people.\\nIn keeping with India's impressive mobility \\nas an economy, the vision of your company \\nis to be the best performing in its sphere. \\nA crucial fac tor behind Texmaco's \\ngrowing levels of excellence has been \\nour prioritisation of technological \\nadvancement and alignment. As a \\ncompany that considers technology to be \\na vital thrust area, we will continue to push \\nthe envelope when it comes to harnessing \\nstate-of-the-art facilities and striving for \\nexcellence in our domain.\\nWe have walked that talk with a strategic \\ntie-up with Hindalco, the world's largest \\naluminium rolling and recycling company, \\nfor the manufacturing of aluminium rail \\nwagons and coaches and the requisite \\ncomponents for this ecosystem. The \\naluminium freight rakes are 180 tonnes \\nlighter and oﬀer 19 per cent higher \\npayload-to-tare weight ratio. In the \\nprocess, they consume less energy, with \\nnegligible wear and tear. The aluminium \\nwagons are best suited for high-speed \\ntrains, a focal point for the Indian Railways \\ndriven by the 'Mission 3,000 MT' dream to \\ndouble the freight capacity to 3,000 million \\ntonnes by 2027. \\nDemerging our EPC Division is another \\ndynamic step towards leveraging focused \\ng ro w t h  o p p o r t u n i t i e s  i n  R a i l w ay s \\ninfrastructure in the coming years. Parallel \\nto the Rolling Stock, our sights are now \\nﬁrmly set on the Foundry business, where \\nthere is huge headroom in building freight \\ncar component capacity. \\nOurs is the only Foundry in the Country to \\nhave approval from (AAR) Association of \\nAmerican Railroads, apart from also being \\napproved by American Society for \\nInternational Designs. Texmaco is the only \\nexporter of steel castings in India and we \\nare aiming to increase our exports further.\\nON THE FAST TRACK\\nThe Indian Railways, the Rs 2.44 lakh crore \\nlifeline ferrying more than 58,580 lakh \\npeople across routes spanning over 68,043 \\nkm, is the lifeblood for your company. \\nUnder the able and dynamic leadership of \\nthe Honourable Minister of Railways, \\nShri Ashwini Vaishnaw, India is truly on the \\nfast track, with the Indian Railways \\naccounting for the largest capital \\ninvestment in the world.\\nThe Railways have invested Rs 1 lakh crore \\nin widening their reach and augmenting \\ncapacity through new high capacity lines \\nas well as doubling including multi-\\ntracking. Around 6,565 km of railway track \\nwas electriﬁed at an investment of Rs 6,657 \\ncrore in FY23. The Ministry of Railways has \\nlined up Rs 25,913 crore towards safety. \\nHigher investments in the Dedicated \\nFreight Corridor (DFC) and the Mumbai-\\nAhmedabad bullet train project have \\nensured rapid progress. The Indian \\nRailways' fast-track approach and the \\ngovernment's push for Atmanirbhar \\nBharat have catalysed your company to \\nchart new frontiers. After ending the year \\nwith a topline of Rs 2,600.25 crore, we are \\nnow planning to ramp up our production \\ncapacity by 25 to 30 per cent. A steady rise \\nin the demand for wagons from the Indian \\nRailways helped improve our operational \\nmargins, translating into an 8.5 per cent \\nrise in our bottomline to Rs 19.84 crore in \\nFY23. We entered the new ﬁscal with an \\norder book of Rs 9,000 crore. \\nIndia's love aﬀair with trains added a new \\nchapter in the 160-year-old history of the \\nRailways with the ﬂagging oﬀ of Vande \\nBharat. And with the government deciding \\nto manufacture the Vande Bharat trains \\nin India, we are expecting substantial \\ngrowth in our overall business by the end \\nof 2023-24. \\nWHERE TIRELESS STRIVING STRETCHES \\nITS ARMS TOWARDS PERFECTION\\nAt Texmaco, we contribute in our own \\nway to shaping tomorrow's India, one \\nthat is economically stronger, socially \\nresponsible, environmentally sustainable, \\nand technologically superior. This can only \\nbe achieved if we have a collective vision of \\nsustainable transformation aligned with \\nthe march of time and technology.\\nAt Texmaco, our Team is our Greatest Asset. \\nOur success story is scripted by our \\nenterprising employees across rank and \\nﬁle, whose dedication drives us forward. \\nYour commitment to excel and surpass the \\nexpectations of our customers at every \\nstep has propelled the company to a \\nleadership role in India's growth story. \\nIf we as a company aim to be on the fast \\ntrack, we have to keep evolving, keep \\nadapting and keep innovating in our quest \\nfor excellence. And as we join hands to \\nkeep the wheels of progress turning at \\nTexmaco, let us turn to Rabindranath \\nTagore for inspiration and pledge to create \\na company “where tireless striving \\nstretches its arms towards perfection” .\\nOn that note, ladies and gentlemen, it is my \\npleasure to present to you the Annual \\nReport for 2022-23.\\nS.K.

The Russia - Ukraine war disrupted the \\nchances of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 \\npandemic, at least in the short term.\\nHowever, despite these critical challenges, India emerged as \\nthe fastest growing major economy in the world. The second \\nadvance estimate of national income released by the Central \\nth\\nStatistics Oﬃce (CSO) on 28  February 2023 expects real GDP \\ngrowth in to be 7.0% and that of gross value added to be 6.6%. \\nIndian Railway had registered highest ever Freight Loading & \\nrevenue jump and which was 27.75% compared to the \\nprevious ﬁscal and more than 77% jump in procurement of \\nrolling stock .\"),\n",

The Railways is also taking an \\ninitiative to improve the design of wagons, thereby \\ninviting wagon manufacturers to come out with their \\nown design to improve overall capacity of wagons and \\ncodal life of railway Assets, and to bring the latest \\ntechnology for maintenance in their Railway Workshops. \\nYour Company is working with some of the global \\nplayers in the Railway sector to cater to the above \\ndemand from Indian Railways.\\n Your Company has entered into a 50:50 Joint Venture \\nAgreement with M/s NYMWAG CS a.s. – AZC Group, one \\nof the leading European conglomerates having \\ndiversiﬁed businesses for manufacturing Wagons and \\nWagon Components. To start with, the Joint Venture will \\nmanufacture wagons and its components for domestic \\nmarket, with further scope to supply to European \\nMarkets, thereby ensuring an entry to coveted European \\nmarkets.\\n Since in the beginning of the year till the Company \\nreceived mammoth order from Indian Railways, the \\nCompany's order book was mainly for private orders, \\nwhich was not enough as per capacity and its production \\ngot seriously impacted. As a result, plants had to go idle \\nfor the want of availability of wheelsets. Moreover, \\nimport of wheelsets for wagons was not permitted \\nearlier, which was later allowed on a later date \\nconsidering the large requirement of wagons and the \\nlimitation of Rail Wheel Factory to meet such large \\ndemand of wheelsets against wagon orders from private \\nparties. Your Company successfully completed the \\nnd\\nprototype in mid of 2  Quarter, and started the series \\nproduction thereafter. The second half of the year ended \\nwith a higher turnover and better proﬁtability owing \\nexecution of series production for Indian Railway and \\nbringing in operational eﬃciency.\\n Your Directors are pleased to inform that during the year, \\nyour Company also exported 100 Gondola Wagons to \\nLiberia and were appreciated for the supply of quality \\nwagons. The customer further awarded your Company \\nwith additional orders of 300 Wagons. Your Company \\ncontinues to receive multiple enquires from various \\ninternational customers.\\nII.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and \\nto issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. \\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is \\nnot a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \\nwith SAs will always detect a material misstatement when \\nit exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and \\nare considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, \\nthey could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the \\neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \\nﬁnancial statements.\\n12. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional \\nskepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n l Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or \\nerror, design and per form audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \\nthat is suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for \\nour opinion.

If \\nwe conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are \\nrequired to draw attention in our auditor's report to \\nthe related disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements or, \\nif such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our \\nopinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit \\nevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's \\nreport. However, future events or conditions may \\ncause the Company to cease to continue as a going \\nconcern.\\n l Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and \\ncontent of the ﬁnancial statements, including the \\ndisclosures, and whether the ﬁnancial statements \\nrepresent the underlying transactions and events in a \\nmanner that achieves fair presentation.\\n13. We communicate with those charged with governance \\nregarding, among other matters, the planned scope and \\ntiming of the audit and signiﬁcant audit ﬁndings, \\nincluding any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies in internal control \\nthat we identify during our audit. \\n14. We also provide those charged with governance with a \\nstatement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and to \\ncommunicate with them all relationships and other \\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\n15. From the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of \\nmost signiﬁcance in the audit of the ﬁnancial statements \\nof the current period and are therefore the key audit \\nmatters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report \\nunless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about \\nthe matters or when we determine that a matter should \\nnot be communicated in our report because the adverse \\nconsequences of doing so would reasonably be expected \\nto outweigh the public interest beneﬁts of such \\ncommunication.\\n16.

A Company's internal ﬁnancial control over ﬁnancial \\nreporting is a process designed to provide reasonable \\nassurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and \\nthe preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external purposes \\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples.

Historical cost is generally based on the value of \\nthe consideration given in exchange for goods and \\nservices. Fair value is the price that would be received to \\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \\ntransaction between market participants at the \\nmeasurement date.\\n The Functional currency of the Company is in Indian \\nRupees.

All amounts have been rounded oﬀ to \\nthe nearest Lakhs and rounded oﬀ to two decimals \\nexcept for Earnings Per Share and where mentioned \\notherwise.\\n All the assets and liabilities have been classiﬁed as \\ncurrent and non-current as per the company\\'s normal \\noperating cycle and criteria set out in schedule III \\n(Division II) of the Companies Act 2013.\\n The Company has ascertained it\\'s operating cycle as 12 \\nmonths for the purpose of current and non- current \\nclassiﬁcation of assets and liabilities.\\n(iii) Use of Estimates\\n The preparation of the Financial Statements in \\nconformity with INDAS requires the management to \\nmake estimates, judgments and assumptions. These \\nestimates, judgment and assumptions aﬀect the \\napplication of accounting policies and the reported \\namount of Assets and Liabilities and disclosure of \\ncontingent Liabilities on the date of the Financial \\nStatements and reported amounts of revenues and \\nexpenses for the year. \\n Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on \\nan ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are \\nrecognized in the period in which the estimates are \\nrevised and future periods are aﬀected.\\n Key sources of estimation of uncertainty at the date of \\nthe ﬁnancial statements, which may cause a material \\nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and \\nliabilities within the next ﬁnancial year, is in respect of \\nimpairment of investments, useful lives of property, \\nplant and equipment, valuation of deferred tax assets, \\nprovisions and contingent liabilities and fair value \\nmeasurement of ﬁnancial instruments have been \\ndiscussed below. Key source of estimation of \\nuncertainty in respect of revenue recognition and \\nemployee beneﬁts have been discussed in their \\nrespective policies.\\n Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\\n The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant \\nand equipment at the end of each reporting period. This \\nreassessment may result in change in depreciation \\nexpense in future periods.\\n Valuation of deferred tax assets\\n The Company reviews the carrying amount of deferred \\ntax assets at the end of each year. The policy has been \\nexplained under note B (xxii).\\n(iv) Property, plant and equipment\\n Property, plant and equipment are carried at the cost of \\nacquisition revalued amount or construction less \\naccumulated depreciation. Costs directly attributable to \\nacquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and \\nequipment are ready for use, as intended by \\nmanagement. \\n Depreciation has been provided on straight line method \\nin accordance with the life of the respective assets as \\nprescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 \\nexcept certain assets for which useful life of assets has \\nbeen ascertained based on report of technical experts. \\nAll assets costing \\x00 5,000 or below are fully depreciated \\nin the year of addition.\\n The Company, based on technical assessment made by \\ntechnical exper t and management estimate, \\ndepreciates Building and Plant & Equipment over \\nestimated useful lives which are diﬀerent from the useful \\nAnnual Report 2022-23Texmaco Rail & Engineering Ltd.\\n100\\nNotes to Financial Statement'),\n",

The \\nestimated useful lives and residual value are reviewed at \\nthe end of each reporting period, with the eﬀect of any \\nchange in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. \\nThe estimated useful lives are as mentioned below:\\n · Buildings (Site Oﬃce)   3 years\\n · Buildings/Investment Property    30 to 60 years\\n · Roads 5 to 10 years\\n · Railway Sidings 15 to 30 years\\n · Electrical Machinery 10 to 20 years\\n · Plant & Equipment 5to 17 years\\n · Furniture 10 years\\n · Oﬃce Equipment 5 years\\n · Computers 3 years\\n · Motor Vehicles 8 years\\n · Intangible Assets (Softwares) 6 years\\n \\n Capital work-in-progress\\n Capital work-in-progress / Intangible assets under \\ndevelopment are carried at cost, comprising direct cost, \\nrelated incidental expenses and attributable borrowing \\ncost. Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, \\nplant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet \\ndate is classiﬁed as Capital Advances.\\n  Investment Properties\\n Properties that are held for - long term rental yields or for \\ncapital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by \\nthe Company, is classiﬁed as investment property. \\nInvestment property is measured initially at its cost, \\nincluding related transaction costs and where \\napplicable borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is \\ncapitalised to the asset's carrying amount only when it is \\nprobable that future economic beneﬁts associated with \\nexpenditure will ﬂow to the Company and the cost of the \\nitem can be measured reliably. All other repairs and \\nmaintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When \\npart of an investment property is replaced, the carrying \\namount of the replaced part is derecognised.  \\n(v) Intangible Assets\\n Intangible Assets are recorded at the consideration paid \\nfor acquisition less accumulated amortization and \\naccumulated impairment, if any, Amortization is \\nrecognized at Straight Line Basis over their estimated \\nuseful life.  The estimated useful life and amortization \\nmethod are reviewed at the end of each reporting \\nperiod, with the eﬀect of any changes in estimate being \\naccounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets \\nwith indeﬁnite useful lives that are acquired separately \\nare carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. \\nIntangible assets are amortized on Straight Line Basis \\nover a period of 6 years.\\n(vi) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\\n Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying \\namount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is \\nrecognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying \\namount exceeds its recoverable amount. The \\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value \\nless costs of disposal and value in use. Value in use is the \\npresent value of estimated future cash ﬂows expected to \\narise from the continuing use of an asset and from its \\ndisposal at the end of its useful life. For the purposes of \\nassessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest \\nlevels for which there are separately identiﬁable cash \\ninﬂows which are largely independent of the cash \\ninﬂows from other assets or group of assets (cash-\\ngenerating units).\\n(vii) Derivative Financial Instrument\\n The Company enters into derivative ﬁnancial \\ninstruments to manage its exposure to foreign \\nexchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward \\ncontracts. The Company holds derivative ﬁnancial \\ninstruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts \\nto mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on \\nforeign currency exposures. The counter party for these \\ncontracts is generally a bank.\\n Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the \\ndate the derivative contracts are entered into and are \\nsubsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of \\neach reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is \\nrecognized to statement proﬁt or loss immediately. \\n(viii) Financial Instrument\\n The Company recognizes ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial \\nliabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument. All ﬁnancial assets and \\nliabilities are recognized at fair value on initial \\nrecognition, except for trade receivables which are \\ninitially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs \\nthat are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of \\nﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities, that are not \\nmeasured at fair value through proﬁt or loss, are added/ \\ndeducted to the fair value on initial recognition.\\n All recognized ﬁnancial assets are subsequently \\nmeasured in their entirety at either amortized cost or fair \\nvalue, depending on the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnancial \\nassets.\\nNotes to Financial Statement\\nFinancial StatementsStatutory ReportsCorporate Overview\"),\n",

Where the Company is the lessee\\n  Right-of-use assets\\n  The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the \\ncommencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the \\nunderlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use \\nassets are measured at cost, less any accumulated \\ndepreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted \\nfor any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of \\nright-of-use assets includes the present value of \\nlease payments to be made over the lease term, \\ninitial direct costs incurred, and lease payments \\nmade at or before the commencement date less any \\nlease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are \\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease \\nagreement period of underlying assets. \\n  If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the \\ncompany at the end of the lease term or the cost \\nreﬂects the exercise of a purchase option, \\ndepreciation is calculated using the estimated \\nuseful life of the asset.\\n  Lease Liabilities\\n  At the commencement date of the lease, the \\nCompany recognises lease liabilities measured at \\nthe present value of lease payments to be made over \\nthe lease term. The lease payments include ﬁxed \\npayments (including in substance ﬁxed payments) \\nless any lease incentives receivable, variable lease \\npayments that depend on an index or a rate, and \\namounts expected to be paid under residual value \\nguarantees. The lease payments also include the \\nexercise price of a purchase option reasonably \\ncertain to be exercised by the company and \\npayments of penalties for terminating the lease, if \\nthe lease term reﬂects the company exercising the \\noption to terminate. Variable lease payments that do \\nnot depend on an index or a rate are recognised as \\nexpenses (unless they are incurred to produce \\ninventories) in the period in which the event or \\ncondition that triggers the payment occurs.\\n  In calculating the present value of lease payments, \\nthe Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at \\nthe lease commencement date because the interest \\nrate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. \\nAfter the commencement date, the amount of lease \\nliabilities is increased to reﬂect the accretion of \\ninterest and reduced for the lease payments made. \\nIn addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is \\nremeasured if there is a modiﬁcation, a change in the \\nlease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., \\nchanges to future payments resulting from a change \\nin an index or rate used to determine such lease \\npayments) or a change in the assessment of an \\noption to purchase the underlying asset.\\n b. Where the Company is the lessor\\n  Assets subject to operating leases are included in \\nﬁxed assets. Lease income is recognized in the \\nstatement of proﬁt and loss on a straight-line basis \\nover the lease term.

Initial direct costs such as legal costs, \\nbrokerage costs, etc. are recognized immediately in \\nthe statement of Proﬁt &Loss.\\n  Assets given under a ﬁnance lease are recognized as \\na receivable at an amount equal to the net \\ninvestment in the lease.

Non-monetary items carried at \\nhistorical cost are translated using exchange rates at the \\ndates of the initial transaction.\\n(xviii) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent \\nAssets\\n a. Provisions & Warranties\\n  Provisions are recognized when the Company has a \\npresent obligation (legal or constructive) as a result \\nof past event, it is probable that the Company will be \\nrequired to settle the obligation, and a reliable \\nestimate can be made of the amount of the \\nobligation.\\n  The amount recognized as a provision is the best \\nestimate of the consideration required to settle the \\npresent obligation at the end of the reporting \\nperiod, tak ing into account the risks and \\nuncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a \\nprovision is measured using the cash ﬂows \\nestimated to settle the present obligation, its \\ncarrying amount is the present value of those cash \\nﬂows (when the eﬀect of the time value of money is \\nmaterial).\\n  When some or all of the economic beneﬁts required \\nto settle a provision are expected to be recovered \\nfrom a third party, a receivable is recognized as an \\nasset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will \\nbe received and the amount of the receivable can be \\nmeasured reliable.\\n  Provisions for the expected cost of warranty \\nobligations under local sale of goods legislation are \\nrecognize at the date of sale of the relevant products, \\nat the management's best estimate of the \\nexpenditure -required to settle the Company's \\nwarranty obligation.\\n b. Onerous contracts\\n  An onerous contract is considered to exist where the \\nCompany has a contrac t under which the \\nunavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under \\nthe contract exceed the economic beneﬁts expected \\nto be received from the contract. Present obligation \\narising under onerous contracts are recognized and \\nmeasured as provisions.\\n c. Contingent liabilities\\n  Contingent liability is a possible obligation that \\narises from past events and the existence of which \\nwill be conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-\\noccurrence of one or more uncertain future events \\nnot wholly within the control of the Company; or is a \\npresent obligation that arises from past events but is \\nnot recognized because either it is not probable that \\nan outﬂow of resources embodying economic \\nbeneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation, or a \\nreliable estimate of the amount of the obligation \\ncannot be made. Contingent liabilities are disclosed \\nand not recognized. In the normal course of \\nbusiness, contingent liabilities may arise from \\nlitigation and other claims against the Company. \\nGuarantees are also provided in the normal course of \\nbusiness. There are certain obligations which \\nmanagement has concluded, based on all available \\nfacts and circumstances, are no probable of \\npayment or are very diﬃcult to quantify reliably, and \\nsuch obligations are treated as contingent liabilities \\nand disclosed in the notes but are not reﬂected as \\nliabilities in the standalone ﬁnancial statements. \\nAlthough there can be no assurance regarding the \\nﬁnal outcome of the legal proceedings in which the \\nCompany is involved, it is not expected that such \\ncontingencies will have a material eﬀect on its \\nﬁnancial position or proﬁtability.\\n d. Contingent Assets\\n  Contingent Assets are neither recognized nor \\ndisclosed except when realization of income is \\nvirtually certain.\\n(xix) Cash & Cash Equivalents\\n The Company considers all highly liquid ﬁnancial \\ninstruments, which are readily convertible into known \\namount of cash that are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of \\nchange in value and having original maturities of less \\nthan three months or less from the date of purchase, to \\nbe cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist \\nof balance with banks which are unrestricted for \\nwithdrawal and usage. \\n(xx) Borrowing Cost\\n Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, \\nconstruction or production of qualifying assets, which \\nare assets that necessarily take a substantial period of \\ntime to get ready for their intended use or sale, are \\nadded to the cost of those assets, until such time as the \\nassets are substantially ready for their intended use. \\n(xxi) Segment Reporting\\n a) Based on the organizational structures and its \\nFinancial Reporting System, the Company has \\nclassiﬁed its operation into three business segments \\nnamely Heavy Engineering Division and Steel \\nNotes to Financial Statement\"),\n",

Current income taxes\\n  The current income tax expense includes income \\ntaxes payable by the Company and its branches in \\nIndia and overseas. The current tax payable by the \\nCompany in India is Indian income tax payable on \\nworldwide income. Current income tax payable by \\noverseas branches of the Company is computed in \\naccordance with the tax laws applicable in the \\njurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. \\nThe taxes paid are generally available for set oﬀ \\nagainst the Indian income tax liability of the \\nCompany's worldwide income. Advance taxes and \\nprovisions for current income taxes are presented in \\nthe balance sheet after oﬀ-setting advance tax paid \\nand income tax provision arising in the same tax \\njurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit \\nintends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.\\n b. Deferred income taxes\\n  Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance \\nsheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and \\nliabilities are recognized for deductible and taxable \\ntemporary diﬀerences arising between the tax base \\nof assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, \\nexcept when the deferred income tax arises from the \\ninitial recognition of an asset or liability in a \\ntransaction that is not a business combination and \\naﬀects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss at \\nthe time of the transaction. Deferred income tax \\nassets are recognized to the extent that it is probable \\nthat taxable proﬁt will be available against which the \\ndeductible temporary diﬀerences and the carry \\nforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses \\ncan be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred \\nincome tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date \\nand reduced to the extent that it is no longer \\nprobable that suﬃcient taxable proﬁt will be \\navailable to allow all or part of the deferred income \\ntax asset to be utilized.\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using \\nsubstantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to \\ntaxable income in the years in which the temporary \\ndiﬀerences are expected to be received or settled.\\n  Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax \\n(MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, \\nwhich is likely to give future economic beneﬁts in the \\nform of availability of set oﬀ against future income \\ntax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognized as \\ndeferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the \\nasset can be measured reliably and it is probable that \\nthe future economic beneﬁt associated with the \\nasset will be realized.\\n(xxiii) Government Grant\\n The Company may receive government grants that \\nrequire compliance with certain conditions related to \\nthe Company's operating activities or are provided to \\nthe Company by way of ﬁnancial assistance on the basis \\nof certain qualifying criteria. Government grants are \\nrecognized when there is reasonable assurance that the \\ngrant will be received, and the Company will comply \\nwith the conditions attached to the grant. Accordingly, \\ngovernment grants:\\n (a) related to or used for assets are included in the \\nBalance Sheet as deferred income and recognized as \\nincome over the useful life of the assets.\\n (b)  related to incurring speciﬁc expenditures are taken \\nto the Statement of Proﬁt and Loss on the same basis \\nand in the same periods as the expenditures \\nincurred.\\n (c)  by way of ﬁnancial assistance on the basis of certain \\nqualifying criteria are recognized as they become \\nreceivable. In the unlikely event that a grant \\npreviously recognized is ultimately not received, it is \\ntreated as a change in estimate and the amount \\ncumulatively recognized is expensed in the \\nStatement of Proﬁt and Loss.\\n(xxiv) Earnings Per Share\\n Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the \\nNotes to Financial Statement\\nFinancial StatementsStatutory ReportsCorporate Overview\"),\n",

Credit Risk  -  A risk that counter party may not meet its obligations under a ﬁnancial instrument or customer contract, leading to a \\nﬁnancial loss is deﬁned as Credit Risk. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating and ﬁnancial activities.\\n Customer credit risk is managed by the respective marketing department subject to the Company's established policy, \\nprocedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. The Company reviews the creditworthiness of these \\ncustomers on an on-going basis. The Company estimates the expected credit loss on the basis of past data, experience and policy \\nlaid down in this respect. The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of the trade \\nreceivables disclosed in Note 1.11 as the Company does not hold any collateral as security. The Company has a practice to provide \\nfor doubtful debts as per its approved policy.\\nB. Liquidity Risk  - A risk that the Company may not be able to settle or meet its obligations at a reasonable price is deﬁned as liquidity \\nrisks.

The Company's exposure to the risk of change in market interest rates related primarily to the \\ncompany's short term borrowing (excluding commercial paper) with ﬂoating interest rates. For all long term borrowings with \\nﬂoating rates, the risk of variation in the interest rates is mitigated through interest rate swaps. The Company constantly monitors \\nthe credit markets and rebalances its ﬁnancing strategies to achieve on optimal maturity proﬁle and ﬁnancing cost.\\nD. Market Risk  - A risk that the fair value of future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument may ﬂuctuate because of changes in market \\nprices is deﬁned as Marketing Risk. Such changes in the value of ﬁnancial instruments may result from changes in the foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. \\n (i) Foreign Currency Risk - A risk that the fair value or future value of the cash ﬂows of an forex exposure will ﬂuctuate because of \\nchanges in foreign exchange rates is deﬁned as Foreign Currency Risk. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in \\nforeign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company's export, import and foreign currency loan/ derivatives operating \\nactivities. The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments primarily \\nto hedge foreign exchange exposure. The management monitors the foreign exchange ﬂuctuations on a continuous basis.\\n (ii) Foreign currency sensitivity - The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD and \\nEuro exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Company's proﬁt before tax is due to changes \\nin the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. The Company's exposure to foreign currency changes for all other \\ncurrencies are not material.\\nFinancial StatementsStatutory ReportsCorporate Overview\"),\n",

Measurement of fair values\\n The table shown below analyses ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.

Valuation techniques \\n The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values\\n 1)  Fair value of the cash and short term deposits, current loans and advances and other current ﬁnancial liabilities, short term \\nborrowing from banks and other ﬁnancial institutions and other similar items approximate their carrying value largely due to \\nshort term maturities of these instruments.\\n 2)  Long-term receivables/borrowings are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such as interest rates, speciﬁc \\ncountry risk factors, individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the ﬁnanced project. Based on \\nthis evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected credit losses of these receivables. \\n 3)  The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks/ﬁnancial institution and other ﬁnancial liabilities are estimated by \\ndiscounting future cash ﬂows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.\\nNote 1.60    Financial Instruments (Contd.)\\nNote 1.61   Tax Expense\\n  Particulars                                                                                          For the Y ear ended \\n   31 March, 2022     31 March, 2023 \\na)  Tax Expense    \\n Current Tax    \\n -  Current tax on proﬁts for the year   -                        32.00 \\n -  Adjustments for current tax of prior periods  -                        43.59 \\n Total current tax expense                               -                          75.59  \\n Deferred Tax    \\n -  Decrease/(increase) in deferred tax assets 1169.75                 1,405.96 \\n -  (Decrease)/increase in deferred tax liabilities                 (281.75)                    (69.09)\\n -  Total deferred tax expenses/(beneﬁt)                      888.00                  1,336.87  \\n MAT credit entitlement                               -                                 -      \\nTax Expense                      888.00                  1,412.46      \\nb)  Reconciliation of tax expenses and the accounting proﬁt multiplied by India's tax rate     \\n Proﬁt before tax                  2,871.66                  3,241.91 \\n Tax at the Indian tax rate of 34.944%(previous year - 34.944%)                  1,003.47                  1,132.85 \\n Tax eﬀect of amounts which are not deductible (taxable) in calculating taxable income    \\n -  Corporate social responsibility expenditure 7.47                         2.68 \\n Tax eﬀect of amounts which are deductible (non-taxable) in calculating taxable income    \\n -  Income from Investment                   (34.69)                    (55.56)\\n -  Income from rented property                 (106.23)                    (97.84)\\n -  MAT Credit/carry forward losses adjustment & Others                    (280.52)\\n Tax eﬀect of other adjustment    \\n -  Income from Investment                      667.26 \\n -  Income tax for earlier years                         43.59 \\n - Others 17.98                              -   \\nTax Expense                      888.00                  1,412.46\"),\n",

From the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of \\nmost signiﬁcance in the audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial \\nstatements of the current period and are therefore the key \\naudit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matters or when we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the \\nadverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be \\nexpected to outweigh the public interest beneﬁts of such \\ncommunication.\\n16. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the \\nconsolidated ﬁnancial statements that, individually or in \\naggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions \\nof a reasonably knowledgeable user of the ﬁnancial \\nstatements may be inﬂuenced. We consider quantitative \\nmateriality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope \\nof our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; \\nand (ii) to evaluate the eﬀect of any identiﬁed \\nmisstatements in the ﬁnancial statements.\\nOther Matters\\n17 (a) In one of the subsidiaries audited by us, there exists a \\nmaterial uncertainty relating to the going concern the \\nsubsidiary has a negative net worth as a result of \\naccumulated losses. Further, the subsidiary is yet to \\ncommence commercial operations and did not have \\nany operational revenue during the year. These \\nconditions may cast signiﬁcant doubt about the \\nsubsidiary's ability to continue as a going concern. As \\nstated in the note 1.42 of the consolidated ﬁnancial \\nstatements, the Management intends to continue the \\noperations of the Company and is in discussion with \\ncouple of technology provider to explore its \\nsustainability in Indian Market. Accordingly, the \\nﬁnancial statements of the subsidiary have been \\nprepared on a going concern basis.\\n (b) We did not audit the ﬁnancial statements of one \\nsubsidiary included in the consolidated ﬁnancial \\nstatements, whose ﬁnancial statements reﬂect total \\nassets of \\x00 6455.50 lakhs as at March 31, 2023, total \\nrevenues of \\x00 331.88 lakhs, total net proﬁt after tax of \\x00 \\n23.46 lakhs and total comprehensive income of \\n\\x00 23.46 lakhs and cash ﬂows (net) of \\x00 (2.46) lakhs for \\nthe year ended on that date as considered in the \\nﬁnancial statements. The consolidated ﬁnancial \\nstatements also include the Group's share of net proﬁt \\nof \\x001427.25 lakhs and total comprehensive income of \\n\\x00 1428.53 lakhs for the year ended March 31, 2023 as \\nconsidered in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in \\nrespect of two jointly controlled entities, whose \\nﬁnancial statements have not been audited by us. \\nThese ﬁnancial statements have been audited by \\nother auditors whose reports have been furnished to \\nus by the Management and our opinion on these \\nconsolidated ﬁnancial statements, in so far as it relates \\nto the amount and disclosures included in respect of \\nthe subsidiary and these jointly controlled entities are \\nbased solely on the reports of such other auditors. \\n Our opinion on the consolidated Financial Statements is \\nnot modiﬁed in respect of the above matters with respect \\nto our reliance on the work done and the reports of the \\nother auditors.\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\\n18.

The Management believes that these \\nestimated useful lives are realistic and reﬂect fair \\napproximation of the period over which the assets are \\nlikely to be used. The estimated useful lives and residual \\nvalue are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, \\nwith the eﬀect of any change in estimate accounted for \\non a prospective basis. The estimated useful lives are as \\nmentioned below:\\n l Buildings (Site Oﬃce)  3 years\\n l Buildings/Investment Property 30 to 60 years\\n l Roads  5 to 10 years\\n l Railway Sidings 15 to 30 years\\n l Electrical Machinery 10 to 20 years\\n l Plant & Equipment 5to 17 years\\n l Furniture 10 years\\n l Oﬃce Equipment 5 years\\n l Computers 3 years\\n l Motor Vehicles 8 years\\n l Intangible Assets (Software) 6 years\\n \\n Capital work-in-progress\\n Capital work-in-progress / Intangible assets under \\ndevelopment are carried at cost, comprising direct cost, \\nrelated incidental expenses and attributable borrowing \\ncost. Advances paid towards the acquisition of \\nproperty, plant and equipment outstanding at each \\nBalance Sheet date is classiﬁed as Capital Advances.\\n Investment Properties\\n Properties that are held for - long term rental yields or for \\ncapital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by \\nthe Company, is classiﬁed as investment property. \\nInvestment property is measured initially at its cost, \\nincluding related transaction costs and where \\napplicable borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is \\ncapitalised to the asset's carrying amount only when it \\nis probable that future economic beneﬁts associated \\nwith expenditure will ﬂow to the Company and the cost \\nof the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs \\nand maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. \\nWhen part of an investment property is replaced, the \\ncarrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.  \\n(v) Intangible Assets\\n Intangible Assets are recorded at the consideration paid \\nfor acquisition less accumulated amortization and \\naccumulated impairment, if any, Amortization is \\nrecognized at Straight Line Basis over their estimated \\nuseful life.  The estimated useful life and amortization \\nmethod are reviewed at the end of each reporting \\nperiod, with the eﬀect of any changes in estimate being \\naccounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets \\nwith indeﬁnite useful lives that are acquired separately \\nare carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. \\nIntangible assets are amortized on Straight Line Basis \\nover a period of 6 years.\\n(vi) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\\n Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying \\namount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is \\nrecognized for the amount by which the asset's \\ncarrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The \\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value \\nless costs of disposal and value in use. Value in use is the \\npresent value of estimated future cash ﬂows expected \\nto arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its \\ndisposal at the end of its useful life.

The \\nCompany has an established control framework with \\nrespect to the measurement of fair values.\\n Fair Values are categorized into diﬀerent levels in a fair \\nvalue hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation \\ntechniques as follows:\\n l Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active \\nmarkets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n l Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in \\nLevel 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, \\neither directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived \\nfrom prices).\\n l Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not \\nbased on observable market data (unobservable \\ninputs).\\n When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the \\ncompany uses observable market data as far   as \\npossible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an \\nasset or a liability fall into a diﬀerent level of the fair value \\nhierarchy, then the fair value measurement is \\ncategorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair \\nvalue hierarchy as the lowest level input that is \\nsigniﬁcant to the entire measurement.\\nAnnual Report 2022-23Texmaco Rail & Engineering Ltd.\\n166\\nNotes on Consolidated Financial Statement\"),\n",

The cost \\nof right-of-use assets includes the present value of \\nlease payments to be made over the lease term, \\ninitial direct costs incurred, and lease payments \\nmade at or before the commencement date less any \\nlease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are \\ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease \\nagreement period of underlying assets. \\n  If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the \\ncompany at the end of the lease term or the cost \\nreﬂects the exercise of a purchase option, \\ndepreciation is calculated using the estimated \\nuseful life of the asset.\\n   Lease Liabilities\\n  At the commencement date of the lease, the \\nCompany recognises lease liabilities measured at \\nthe present value of lease payments to be made \\nover the lease term. The lease payments include \\nﬁxed payments (including in substance ﬁxed \\npayments) less any lease incentives receivable, \\nvariable lease payments that depend on an index or \\na rate, and amounts expected to be paid under \\nresidual value guarantees. The lease payments also \\ninclude the exercise price of a purchase option \\nreasonably certain to be exercised by the company \\nand payments of penalties for terminating the lease, \\nif the lease term reﬂects the company exercising the \\noption to terminate. Variable lease payments that \\ndo not depend on an index or a rate are recognised \\nas expenses (unless they are incurred to produce \\ninventories) in the period in which the event or \\ncondition that triggers the payment occurs.\\n   In calculating the present value of lease payments, \\nthe Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at \\nthe lease commencement date because the interest \\nrate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. \\nAfter the commencement date, the amount of lease \\nliabilities is increased to reﬂect the accretion of \\ninterest and reduced for the lease payments made. \\nIn addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is \\nremeasured if there is a modiﬁcation, a change in \\nthe lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., \\nchanges to future payments resulting from a \\nchange in an index or rate used to determine such \\nlease payments) or a change in the assessment of an \\noption to purchase the underlying asset.\\n b. Where the Company is the lessor\\n  Assets subject to operating leases are included in \\nﬁxed assets.

There are certain obligations which \\nmanagement has concluded, based on all available \\nfacts and circumstances, are no probable of \\npayment or are very diﬃcult to quantify reliably, and \\nsuch obligations are treated as contingent liabilities \\nand disclosed in the notes but are not reﬂected as \\nliabilities in the standalone ﬁnancial statements. \\nAlthough there can be no assurance regarding the \\nﬁnal outcome of the legal proceedings in which the \\nCompany is involved, it is not expected that such \\ncontingencies will have a material eﬀect on its \\nﬁnancial position or proﬁtability.\\n d.

Revenue and \\nexpenses which are related to the enterprise as a \\nwhole and are not allocable to segments on a \\nreasonable basis have been included under un-\\nallocable expenses.\\n c) Capital Employed to each segment is classiﬁed on \\nthe basis of allocable assets minus allocable \\nliabilities identiﬁable to each segment on \\nreasonable basis.\\n(xxii)  Taxation\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and \\nthe net change in the deferred tax asset or liability \\nduring the year. Current and deferred taxes are \\nrecognized in statement of proﬁt and loss, except when \\nthey relate to items that are recognized in other \\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, in which \\ncase, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in \\nother comprehensive income or directly in equity, \\nrespectively.\\n a. Current income taxes\\n  The current income tax expense includes income \\ntaxes payable by the Company and its branches in \\nIndia and overseas. The current tax payable by the \\nCompany in India is Indian income tax payable on \\nworldwide income. Current income tax payable by \\noverseas branches of the Company is computed in \\naccordance with the tax laws applicable in the \\njurisdiction in which the respective branch \\noperates. The taxes paid are generally available for \\nset oﬀ against the Indian income tax liability of the \\nCompany's worldwide income. Advance taxes and \\nprovisions for current income taxes are presented in \\nthe balance sheet after oﬀ-setting advance tax paid \\nand income tax provision arising in the same tax \\njurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit \\nintends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.\\n b. Deferred income taxes\\n  Deferred income tax is recognized using the \\nbalance sheet approach. Deferred income tax \\nassets and liabilities are recognized for deductible \\nand taxable temporary diﬀerences arising between \\nthe tax base of assets and liabilities and their \\ncarrying amount, except when the deferred income \\ntax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or \\nliability in a transaction that is not a business \\ncombination and aﬀects neither accounting nor \\ntaxable proﬁt or loss at the time of the transaction. \\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized to the \\nextent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be \\navailable against which the deductible temporary \\ndiﬀerences and the carry forward of unused tax \\ncredits and unused tax losses can be utilised. The \\ncarrying amount of deferred income tax assets is \\nreviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the \\nextent that it is no longer probable that suﬃcient \\ntaxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of \\nthe deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured \\nusing substantively enacted tax rates expected to \\napply to taxable income in the years in which the \\ntemporary diﬀerences are expected to be received \\nor settled.\\n  Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative \\nTax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in \\nIndia, which is likely to give future economic \\nbeneﬁts in the form of availability of set oﬀ against \\nfuture income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is \\nrecognized as deferred tax asset in the balance \\nsheet when the asset can be measured reliably and \\nit is probable that the future economic beneﬁt \\nassociated with the asset will be realised.\\n(xxiii)  Government Grant\\n The Company may receive government grants that \\nrequire compliance with certain conditions related to \\nthe Company's operating activities or are provided to \\nthe Company by way of ﬁnancial assistance on the basis \\nof certain qualifying criteria. Government grants are \\nrecognized when there is reasonable assurance that the \\ngrant will be received, and the Company will comply \\nwith the conditions attached to the grant.

Measurement of fair values          \\n The table shown below analyses ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.

Valuation techniques                      \\n The  following  methods and assumptions were used to  estimate the fair values      \\n 1)  Fair value of the cash and short term deposits, current loans and advances and other current ﬁnancial liabilities, short term \\nborrowing from banks and other ﬁnancial institutions and other similar items approximate their carrying value largely due to \\nshort term maturities of these instruments.  \\n 2)  Long-term receivables/borrowings are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such as interest rates, speciﬁc country \\nrisk factors, individual credit worthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the ﬁnanced project. Based on this \\nevaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected credit losses of these receivables.   \\n 3)  The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks/ﬁnancial institution and other ﬁnancial liabilities is estimated by \\ndiscounting future cash ﬂows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.\\nNote 1.40   Tax Expense\\n  Particulars  For the Y ear ended \\n   31 March, 2022     31 March, 2023 \\na)  Tax Expense    \\n Current Tax    \\n -  Current tax on proﬁts for the year                         0.10                          32.98 \\n -  Adjustments for current tax of prior periods                           -                            49.99 \\n \\n -  Total current tax expense                                         82.97         0.10      \\n Deferred Tax    \\n -  Decrease/(increase) in deferred tax assets                  1,169.75                    1,404.98 \\n -  (Decrease)/increase in deferred tax liabilities                 (281.99)                       (69.70)\\n -  Total deferred tax expenses/(beneﬁt)                      887.76                    1,335.28 \\nTax Expense     887.86                                     1,418.25  \\nb)  Reconciliation of tax expenses and the accounting proﬁt multiplied by India's tax rate    \\n Proﬁt before tax                  2,041.08                    2,640.25 \\n Tax at the Indian tax rate of 34.944% (previous year - 34.944%)                      713.23                        922.61 \\n Tax eﬀect of amounts which are not deductible (taxable) in calculating taxable income    \\n -  Corporate social responsibility expenditure 7.47                            2.68 \\n Tax eﬀect of amounts which are deductible (non-taxable) in calculating taxable income    \\n -  Income from Investment                   (34.69)                       (20.97)\\n -  Income from rented property                 (106.23)                       (97.14)\\n -  MAT Credit/carry forward losses adjustment & Others                            -                        (106.18)\\n Tax eﬀect of other adjustment    \\n -  Income from Investment -                        667.26 \\n -  Income tax for earlier years -                          49.99 \\n -  Others 308.08                                -   \\nTax Expense                      887.86                    1,418.25\\nNotes on Consolidated Financial Statement\"),\n",
